# Troubleshooting

**Feed Not Showing?**
- Verify your YouTube API key is valid and has quota.
- Ensure the playlist ID starts with `UU` (uploads playlist).
- Check browser console for API errors.

**Playlist ID Tool Fails?**
- Use full channel URLs (with `@` handle or `/channel/` path).
- Channel must have public videos.

**Still stuck?**
- Check the OctoberCMS logs for errors.
- Review the [API Reference](api/) for more details.
